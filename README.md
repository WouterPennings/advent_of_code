# Advent of Code 2021

An attempt to write all the coding challanges in my own programming language called Loop. Loop is still in early development, 
this will count as a test to see where the bugs are hiding and features lacking.

If you want to know more about Loop, go to:
 - [GitHub](https://github.com/looplanguage)
 - [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/looplanguage) (Transitioning from **GitHub** to **GitLab**, not completed)
 - [Looplang.org](https://looplang.org)
 - Download Loop [here](https://downloads.looplang.org)
