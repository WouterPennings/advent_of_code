# Advent of Code 2021

An attempt to write all the coding challanges in my own programming language called Loop. Loop is still in early development, 
this will count as a test to see where the bugs are hiding and features lacking.

Some of these problems will not be solveable because of the lacking features, this will always be the case with data input. For that I will use a language which will do that for me (Prob JavaScript.)

If you want to know more about Loop, go to:
 - [GitHub](https://github.com/looplanguage)
 - [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/looplanguage) (Transitioning from **GitHub** to **GitLab**, not completed)
 - [Looplang.org](https://looplang.org)
 - Download Loop [here](https://downloads.looplang.org)
